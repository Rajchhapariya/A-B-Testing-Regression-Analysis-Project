# A/B Testing Analysis – Marketing Campaign Optimization

## 📊 Project Overview

This project evaluates the effectiveness of two marketing campaigns using A/B testing methodology. The objective was to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in campaign performance and to provide data-driven recommendations.

The analysis uses Python for statistical testing, data exploration, and visualization.

## 🎯 Business Problem

A company launched two marketing campaigns (Campaign A and Campaign B) and wants to determine:

- Which campaign performs better?
- Is the difference statistically significant?
- Should one campaign be scaled over the other?

---

## 📂 Dataset

File: `marketing_campaign.csv`

The dataset includes:

- Customer demographics
- Income levels
- Spending patterns
- Campaign response indicators
- Purchase behavior
- Engagement metrics

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy / Statsmodels
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values
- Converted data types
- Removed inconsistencies

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Response rate comparison
- Customer segmentation
- Distribution analysis

### 3️⃣ Hypothesis Testing

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  
There is no difference in performance between Campaign A and Campaign B.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**  
There is a statistically significant difference between the two campaigns.

- Significance Level (α) = 0.05
- Applied statistical tests (t-test / proportion test)

### 4️⃣ Statistical Evaluation
- Compared conversion/response rates
- Calculated p-values
- Evaluated statistical significance

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- Identified performance difference between campaigns.
- Determined whether the difference is statistically significant.
- Quantified impact of campaign strategy on customer response.
- Provided evidence-based recommendation for campaign scaling.

## 💡 Business Recommendation

Based on statistical analysis:

- If p-value < 0.05 → Reject null hypothesis → Adopt higher-performing campaign.
- If p-value ≥ 0.05 → No significant difference → Further experimentation recommended.

This ensures marketing budget allocation is optimized using data-driven insights.
